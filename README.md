For this assignment, I chose option 1: Heroes of Pymoli.

I have been assigned to analyze the data for the fantasy game “Heroes of Pymoli.”
This game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. This repository contains a report that breaks down the game’s purchasing data into meaningful insights.
The final report includes the following:
Player Count
•	Total Number of Players
Purchasing Analysis (Total)
•	Number of Unique Items
•	Average Purchase Price
•	Total Number of Purchases
•	Total Revenue
Gender Demographics
•	Percentage and Count of Male Players
•	Percentage and Count of Female Players
•	Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed
Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
•	The below each broken by gender 
o	Purchase Count
o	Average Purchase Price
o	Total Purchase Value
o	Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender
Age Demographics
•	The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.) 
o	Purchase Count
o	Average Purchase Price
o	Total Purchase Value
o	Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group
Top Spenders
•	Identifies the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table): 
o	SN
o	Purchase Count
o	Average Purchase Price
o	Total Purchase Value
Most Popular Items
•	Identifies the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table): 
o	Item ID
o	Item Name
o	Purchase Count
o	Item Price
o	Total Purchase Value
Most Profitable Items
•	Identifies the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table): 
o	Item ID
o	Item Name
o	Purchase Count
o	Item Price
o	Total Purchase Value
The data was analyzed using the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.

There is also a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
